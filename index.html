          Article 370 of the Indian constitution[a] gave special status to Jammu
          and Kashmir, a region located in the northern part of Indian
          subcontinent and part of the larger region of Kashmir which has been
          the subject of a dispute between India, Pakistan and China since
          1947.[4][5] Jammu and Kashmir was administered by India as a state
          from 1954 to 31 October 2019, and Article 370 conferred on it the
          power to have a separate constitution, a state flag, and autonomy of
          internal administration

          On 5 August 2019, the Government of India issued a Presidential Order
          superseding the 1954 order, and making all the provisions of the
          Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. The order was
          based on the resolution passed in both houses of India's parliament
          with two-thirds majority.[11][12][13][14] A further order on 6 August
          made all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative
